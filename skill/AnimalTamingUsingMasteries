///I searched everywhere for a script to use Combat Training Mastery to train Animal Taming from 90.0 onwards. I could not find one, so I
///decided to make this one.
///Make sure that you single-click on the book to set your mastery via its context menu: simply double-clicking the book and selecting the
///mastery will not work.
///This script will cast Combat Training repeatedly until your mana is too low, at which point it will attempt to meditate to restore mana.
///When your mana reaches >143, whether by successful meditation or just waiting, it will then begin to cast Combat Training again.
///My meditation is 0.0 and I still see a speed increase using meditation, so don't worry about raising your Meditation skill for this script!
///You may need to modify the mana line: My character has 145, so I chose >143; YMMV.
///I hope you enjoy this!
